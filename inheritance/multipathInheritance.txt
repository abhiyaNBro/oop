When two or more than two derived classes are formed from a single base class and again these derived classes
re combined as base to another derived class then this type of inheritance is called multipath inheritance.


From above figure, we see that the properties of grandparent is inherited to parent 1 and parent 2 and parent 1
and parent 2 are combined as a base to a derived class child. Due to this, the properties of grandparents will be a
duplicate copy to a derived class child via parent 1 and parent 2.


Sometimes the duplicate copy of properties of grandparents in child class might cause problems so in order to
solve this problem we make ancestor base class or common base class as virtual during inheritance of parent I and
parent 2 . 

Sometimes this type of inheritance is called virtual inheritance.
