VVI:

One class type to another class type conversion in C++ can be performed by two ways:
(i) By the help of one argument parameterized constructor.(like basic to class type)
(ii) By the help of casting operator function.(like class to basic type)


If one argument parameterized constructor is used to convert from one class type to another class type
then the constructor should lie in a destination class.

If we use casting operator function for converting from one class type to another class type then
casting operator function should lie in a source class.
