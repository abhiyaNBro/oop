When base classs and derived class have destructors then to clean off object both the destructors from
base and derived class should be called.

If the base class pointer object is pointing to derived class object and if the base class destructor is non
virtual and if we delete base class pointer object by using delete operator then only the destructor of
base class is called. So in order to call destructors from both base class and derived class, the base class
destructor should be made virtual.
