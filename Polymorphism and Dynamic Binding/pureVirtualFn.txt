A virtual fn of the form:

virtual return_type function_name()=0;

is said to be pure virtual function.

A pure virtual function do not contain body.

The zero after assignment operator indicates that the virtual function is pure.

The class having at least one pure virtual function is said to be an abstract class.

We cannot create normal object of an abstract class but only the pointer object of abstract class can be
created.

The pure virtual function should be overridden in each derived classes because due to inheritance
feature the derived class also becomes as an abstract class due to which normal object of derived classes
cannot be created.
